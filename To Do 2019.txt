     for a split second 
  - Inconsistant in when they randomly run
  - Motor Controller  9

Elevator Brake randomly actuate				Not our Problem [vaccume]
  - The brake solenoid would randomly acutate when 
     the Joystick is not moved.
  - The speed of the actuations vary from high speed
     to once every 30 sec's
  - solenoid (6, 7) 


Linear Actuator is not responding to commands		Not our Probblem [reslolved]	
  - Check the code to see if it is on our end
  - If it is not a code problem, communicate the 
     issue to the build team


Drive Train stopping					Not our Probblem [resolved
  - The drive train is stopping after a few minnutes 
     of use
  - is not disabling the drive station
  - If it is not a code issue, communicate the issue 
     to the build team


Elevator Brake (pnumatic)				
  - when the elevator stops, the pnumatic brake enables
  - when the elevator is moving, the pnumatic brake 
     in not enables

Grabber Studder						
  - The pnumatic o/c is studdering in the solinoid
  - find a way for a the grabber button to stay as 
     a toggle and fix the studder

Comment out the elevator            
 back spin for the pnumatic brake
